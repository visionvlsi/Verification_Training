//RACE CONDITIONS IN VERILOG

1.WRITE-WRITE RACE
2.WRITE/READ OR READ-WRITE RACE
3. THERE IS NO READ READ RACE

initial
 begin
  a=2;//writing or driving values 
  $display(a);//sampling or reading the signal value
 end
 
initial 
 it runs only once throughout your simulation
 it is also procedural block.
 all lhs signals in this initial block should be declared as reg 
 
 you can have any number of initial blocks.
 all the initial blocks will run in parallel
