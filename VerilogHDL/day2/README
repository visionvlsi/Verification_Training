1. WHAT IS REG AND WIRE?

 VERILOG SUPPORTS 2 CATEGORIES
  1. NET DATATYPES
  2. VARIABLE DATATYPES
  
  NET DATATYPES : wire, wor, wand, ....
   1.WIRE :  IT DOESNT HOLD ANY DATATYPES
             IT WILL JUST PASS THE DATA
			 DEFAULT : 1 BIT QUANTITY
			 TO CONNECT BETWEEN TWO MODULES OR GATES
			 VALUES : 0  1 X Z
			 DEFAULT VALUE : Z
	WOR :  
			 
   2.REG : MAINLY IT IS USED IN PROCEDURAL BLOCKS
           PROCEDURAL BLOCKS ALWAYS AND INITIAL
		   IT HAS THE QUALITY TO STORE THE DATA UNTIL IT IS MODIFIED
		    DEFAULT SIZE : 1 BIT
              VALUES :  0, 1 ,X Z
            DEFAULT VALUES : X - UNKNOWN  			 
2. INITIAL BLOCKS :  
    THEY WILL EXECUTE ONLY ONCE
    THEY WILL EXECUTE IN RUN TIME
	IN PROCEDURAL BLOCKS 
	  ALL THE LHS SIGNALS SHOULD BE DECLARED AS REG DATATYPE
3. IN VERILOG WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF EXECUTION
   1.SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION :  BEGIN END
       a=2;
	   b=5;
	   c=6;
   2. PARALLEL EXECUTION   
   
4.TO CHECK OUTPUTS 
   1. WAVEFORMS
   2. LOGS
5. SYSTEM TASK 
    $DISPLAY
	$MONITOR
	$WRITE
	$STROBE:
6.TEST CASE: ONE POSSIBLE  COMBINATION OF VALUES APPLIED TO DUT
 DIRECTED TESTCASE: ALL THE INPUT VALUES APPLIED MANUALLY TO DUT
