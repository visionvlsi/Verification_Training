What are primitives in Verilog?
List out all the Verilog keywords in all modelling styles and from testbenches.
Design a Calling bell circuit with below data
 input switch,en;
 input [31:0]name;
 output cb;

Functionality  : LIST = { ROCK, PAPER , SCISSORS}
 Eg: cb will be 1 if switch is high and en is high and name falls from above list.
       cb will be 0 in below scenarios
            if switch is low or en is high and name appears from above list.
            if switch is low or en is low and name appears from above list.
            if switch is high or en is low and name appears from above list.
            if switch is low or en is high and name doesn't appear from above list.
Hint: Explore how to pass a string to inputs in verilog.
