LEVEL-1:

 Design and implement Priority Encoder.
 Design and implement Or, And, Xor gate using Multiplexer (2×1).
 Design and implement 4-bit adder/sub using structural.
 Design and implement 4-bit CLAA.
 Design and implement a Swap/Buffer circuit using multiplexer.
 Design and implement 8:3encoder.

LEVEL-2:

 Design and implement JK-FlipFlop, D-FlipFlop and T-FlipFlop.
 Design and implement a system which takes 4-bit data and shifts left, right, reverses, passes the data depending upon a control signal(Don’t use any registers).
 Design and implement a 4-bit Counter
 Design and implement a system which takes 8-bit data and stores in memory and based on request it should send data ROM/ RAM.
