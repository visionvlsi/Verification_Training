LEVEL-3:

Ø  1. Write the hardware description of a 4-bit PRBS (pseudo-random Binary

sequence) generator using a linear feedback shift register and test it.?

Ø  2. Write the hardware description of a 8-bit register with shift left and shift right

modes of operation based on selection line and  write its test operation?

Ø  3. Write a program for universal shift register?

Ø  4. write a program for universal synchronous counter which includes up , down and updown counter?

Ø  5. write a program for universal asynchronous counter which includes up , down and updown counter?

Ø  6. Write the hardware description of a 4-bit mod-13 counter and test it.?

Ø  7. write a program for synchronous fifo for 32 locations depth and 16 bit data size?

Ø  8. design and implement asynchronous fifo with write clock 512 mhz and read clock 64 mhz?(hint: calculate the fifo depth and proceed)
