/* PRBS or Pseudo Random Binary Sequence is essentially a random sequence of binary numbers. It is random in a sense that the value of an element of the 
sequence is independent of the values of any of the other elements. It is 'pseudo' because it is deterministic and after N elements it starts to repeat itself, 
unlike real random sequences.. */
